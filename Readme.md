Version 1: 
A small (p5-Javascript) survival game about an astronaut left behind by accident at a foreign planet ! (work in progress). You may view a demo of the project either by downloading the mp4 file or at: https://manostam.github.io/REDET521-p5.js/

Version 2:
This project is about a platform game with a user-controlled character with screen scrolling as the character moves. A survival game where the player moves across the unknowns of the planet REDET-521 to gather resources (mostly gears) to repair his rocket in order to return home. Furthermore he/she will have to stay alive experiencing the hardships of living in a planet with sparse oxygen. Its theme is inspired by the movie “The Martian” and by the game “Don’t Starve Together”.
The game program is written in HTML, CSS and p5.js (a library of Javascript). All you need to do to run it is install VS code and install p5.vscode extension of the VS code program. 
You may find analytical installation instructions and general informations about the game and its creation in the "Project report" pdf.
For a quick preview of the game you may see the two videos listed as "succesful run" and "how you die" in the video-samples folder. 
Enjoy !
