        <h1> How it started... </h1>
        <p> After travelling for several months from one solar system to the next one 
            with his rocketship, Anthony fell in a dangerous spacestorm that took him completely off course and 
            dropped him at a foreign planet. </p>
        <p> Afraid of crashing with his rocketship, he ejected off it as soon as 
            he lost control of it in the thick atmosphere of the unknown planet. </p>
        <p> Now he has to navigate through this Martian like landscape, explore, 
            find and repair his rocketship so that he may resume his journey. </p>
        <p> The planet's oxygen is really sparse so if it wasn't for Anthony's ingenuity 
            building a small base for oxygen replenishment he would die of asphyxiation really soon.</p>
        <h2> How to... </h2>
        <p> navigate Anthony through the REDET-521 planet? </p>
        <p> Use the buttons W, A, S, D to move him respectively up, left, right and down. Zoom in/out with the mousewheel. </p>
        <p> Explore, beware of your oxygen supply and keep your distance from any hostile inhabitants! </p>
        <p> Click the rocket below to start exploring. </p>
